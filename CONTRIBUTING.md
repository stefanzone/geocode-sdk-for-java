# Contributing

> **Note**: In order to contribute you must be a qualified member of the organization.

We accept contributions via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/stefanzone/geocode-sdk-for-java/pulls).

The current version v1 is under active development.

This means any new feature MUST target v1 (`main` branch).

## Pull Requests

- **[Java Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to run a style checker as you code.
- **Add tests!** - Your pull request won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README and the code documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Create topic branches** - We won't pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If your code is changing more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple commits while developing, please remove them before submitting.
- **Ensure tests pass!** - Please run the tests before submitting your pull request, and make sure they pass. We won't accept a pull request until all tests pass.
